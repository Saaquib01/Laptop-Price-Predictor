# Laptop Price Predictor
This is a machine learning model that predicts the prices of laptops based on various features. The model was built using several algorithms such as linear regression, Ridge, Lasso, KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, Extras Trees, Ada boost, Gradient boost, Voting Regressor, and stacking.

The performance of each algorithm was evaluated using the R2_score and MAE metrics. The R2_score for the best performing algorithm was 0.8929729703942917, while the MAE was 0.1551901796317087.

To use the model, it was exported using the pickle module. Users can load the model and use it to predict laptop prices based on the relevant features.
